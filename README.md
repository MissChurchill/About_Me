About Me app using data binding

Checkout my About Me app to learn more about me, Domonique, nickname Tech Nique.  This was a fun app to create while on my learning to code journey taking 
the Udacity Kotlin Android Developer course.  

The app features include:
1. Data binding
2. A scrolling textView
3. Use of a drawable

Here is a short demo of the app that provides information all about me including a short bio.
